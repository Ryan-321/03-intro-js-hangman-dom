# Hangman

## Description
  Used vanilla javascript to create this game to strengthen my JS skills.  I started with the layout: html, css and then added JS on top of that. The JS, originally I had global variables and various functions with a couple of calls, then migrated it to a single object and one call.

  **Hope you enjoy!!!**
